00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.842
Now, William Carlos Williams.

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.161
Here I am.<br><br>

3
00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:09.727
We both [forgot] his poems, later poems that New Directions has published.

4
00:00:09.749 --> 00:00:14.426
So, he says he can’t read any problems because he doesn't know them by heart.

5
00:00:14.448 --> 00:00:16.845
I bet you know some of those little ones, don't you?<br><br>

6
00:00:16.881 --> 00:00:18.242
Very little one you mean?<br><br>

7
00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:20.014
Yes, let’s hear a very little one.<br><br>

8
00:00:20.242 --> 00:00:21.433
Hmm.

9
00:00:21.624 --> 00:00:22.147
It's an old one.<br><br>

10
00:00:22.205 --> 00:00:27.727
Well, there is one, called “The Red Wheelbarrow” that people seem to enjoy.<br><br>

11
00:00:27.852 --> 00:00:28.992
Do “The Red Wheelbarrow.”<br><br>

12
00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:29.992
You’d like “The Red Wheelbarrow”?<br><br>

13
00:00:30.062 --> 00:00:30.595
Yes, I would.<br><br>

14
00:00:30.757 --> 00:00:33.013
Let’s see if I can really remember it.

15
00:00:33.045 --> 00:00:34.479
It's uh.<br><br>

16
00:00:34.558 --> 00:00:37.647
so much depends<br>upon<br><br>a

17
00:00:37.653 --> 00:00:39.374
[the] red wheel<br>barrow<br><br>

18
00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:41.098
glazed with rain<br>water<br><br>

19
00:00:41.146 --> 00:00:43.315
beside the white<br>chickens<br><br>

20
00:00:43.852 --> 00:00:45.977
Good for you.

21
00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:47.289
The poem.

22
00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:51.102
See [he likes] it.<br><br>

23
00:00:51.676 --> 00:00:56.102
One little mistake, I should have said “a red wheelbarrow,” but that’s all right.<br><br>

24
00:00:56.168 --> 00:00:57.315
Maybe you ought to do it again.<br><br>

25
00:00:57.382 --> 00:01:00.455
so much depends<br>upon<br><br>a red wheel<br>barrow<br><br>

26
00:01:00.492 --> 00:01:03.955
glazed with rain<br>water<br><br>beside the white<br>chickens
